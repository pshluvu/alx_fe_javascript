# DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and Working with JSON Data

Welcome to the **DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and Working with JSON Data** project!  
This project guides you through building a dynamic web application that generates, manages, and filters content based on user interactions. You'll explore advanced JavaScript techniques to create interactive and persistent user experiences.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, you will:

- Create and manipulate dynamic content using JavaScript.
- Persist data across browser sessions using **localStorage** and **sessionStorage**.
- Import and export **JSON** data to manage application state.
- Implement a dynamic content filtering system.
- Sync local data with a server and handle potential conflicts.

By the end, you'll have a robust understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts and be able to build dynamic, interactive, and persistent web applications.
